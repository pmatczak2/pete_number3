This code is all about creating a simple system to answer your questions about chess. Imagine it like a mini-Google just for chess rules!
This code utilizes a vector database (chromadb) to store and query information.
The key idea is to convert text (chess rules and questions) into numerical vectors (embeddings) using a sentence transformer model. 
This allows the system to compare the meaning of the question with the meaning of the rules, rather than just matching keywords. When you query the database, it finds the rules with embeddings closest to the question's embedding, indicating the most semantically similar rules. 
This approach enables more accurate and relevant answers compared to simple keyword-based search.
